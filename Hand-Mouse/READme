When you run this script, camera will start to detect and map your hand with landmark.

Once detected, mouse will move to your wherever you move your index position, with pyautogui.moveTo. 

And to make "click" I've implemented the option of touching your index_base with your thumb.

Mouse will move to whenever you put the point 8 of your hand, and to make a click, you have to put together the points 5 and 4 of your hand.
